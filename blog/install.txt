The blog plugin is an example of user in and output
handling with OPF.

it features a simple administration backend, that lets
you author new articles, an image upload, a simple
rich text editor (featuring nicEdit), a simple list
view and a simple detail view.

I have added a demo user:
Username: test
Password: test

if youd like to add a new user, you can simply do that
via your phpmyadmin or db shell like this:

INSERT INTO users SET (username,password,email) 
 VALUES('your_user',md5('your_password'),'your_email');

To install the plugin:
1. unpack/move it to the plugins directory within your
OPF directory.
2. create an empty database, you can change the database
default name by editing blog/hooks/01_params.php and
change $config["db_name"] to fit your needs.
3. import the file "blog.sql" into that database.
4. edit conf/config.php in your OPF root and add
the blog plugin to your plugins.

enjoy my little example;-)
